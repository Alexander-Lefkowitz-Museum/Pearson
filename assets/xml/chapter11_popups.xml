							<p>Having good music at hand is easy thanks to music databases such as Pandora and Spotify. The <i>Music Genome Project</i> makes it possible for these applications to provide music based on specific preferences. Using almost 400 attributes such as “female lead vocalist” or “club rap roots,” the Music Genome Project analyzes, categorizes, and organizes songs into a database that Pandora and Spotify access.</p> 
							<p class="start lessSpacing">With Pandora (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://pandora.com','_blank')">pandora.com</span>), you create radio stations that play music with attributes similar to those you provide. For example, if you enjoy music from The Black Eyed Peas or you  </p>

				<div class="content"><div class="columnContain">
					<div class="column">
						<div class="innerColLeft">
							<p>Web 2.0 applications are about making it easy for users to create and disseminate their own content. So if you have a database that needs populating, why not seek help from the web community to populate it, especially if it’s designed as a resource for the masses?</p>
					  		<p class="start">Yelp (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://yelp.com','_blank')">yelp.com</span>) is conceived as the “yellow pages” for the twenty-first century. Yelp is free to use, and anyone can write a review of a business and post it to the site. Users can easily search the site, find service providers in their area, and see what ratings consumers have given them. Thinking about going to a Mexican restaurant in the San Jose area that you’ve never visited (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.13</span>)? A quick search on Yelp will lead to more than 500 restaurants that fit this criteria. Surely you’ll be able to find one that fits your budget and that other people enjoyed visiting. </p>
					  		<p class="start">However, Yelp is not without its critics. Because it allows anonymous posting, some people argue that businesses may try to increase their ratings by posting their own positive reviews. And Yelp actively markets to businesses to pay for placement of ads on its site that some users may mistake for unsponsored reviews. (To avoid this kind of consumer misinterpretation, the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] now requires commercial websites to clearly identify reviews that are sponsored, but some consumers remain oblivious.)</p>
							<p class="start">An alternative to Yelp that addresses these concerns is Angie’s List. Angie’s List (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://angieslist.com','_blank')">angieslist.com</span>) focuses primarily on service companies and health care professionals, not entertainment and food service businesses. Members pay a monthly fee to access the reviews on Angie’s List. What do you get for your fee? Angie’s List doesn’t permit anonymous reviews. This is a big benefit for business owners because it makes it easier to contact dissatisfied customers and try to resolve issues. Angie’s List also has a verification process with reviewers to ensure that businesses don’t report on themselves. And businesses don’t pay to advertise on Angie’s List; they make it on the site only when they’re reviewed by a consumer.</p>
							<p class="start">Both Yelp and Angie’s List are searchable databases, but whereas most companies usually populate databases themselves, these websites rely on users to create their content. The databases still need to be well designed to capture this content, and processes need to be in place to review the data entered for appropriateness. By harnessing the power of large groups of users to populate a database, the database owners can reap the rewards of saving time, effort, and money.</p>

				<div class="headerText font_20">Structured Query Language (SQL)</div>
				<div class="content"><div class="columnContain">
					<div class="column">
						<div class="innerColLeft">
							<p>To extract records from a database, you use a query language. Almost all relational and object-oriented databases today use Structured Query Language, or SQL. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, IBM DB2, and MySQL are examples of popular databases that use SQL. </p>
					  		<p class="start">SQL uses relational algebra to extract data from databases. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Relational algebra</span> is the use of English-like expressions that have variables and operations, much like algebraic equations. Variables include table names, field names, or selection criteria for the data you wish to display. Operations include directions such as <em>select</em> (which enables you to pick variable names), <em>from</em> (which tells the database which table to use), and <em>where</em> (which enables you to specify selection criteria). The two most common queries used to extract data using relational algebra are select queries and join queries.</p>
					  		<p class="start">A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>select query</span> displays a subset of data from a table (or tables) based on the criteria you specify. A typical select query has the following format:</p>
							<p class="TMargin15 BMargin15">SELECT (Field Name 1, Field Name 2, …)<br/>FROM (Table Name)<br/>WHERE (Selection Criteria)</p>
							<p class="start">The first line of the query contains variables for the field names you want to display. The FROM statement enables you to specify the table name from which the data will be retrieved. The last line (the WHERE statement) is used only when you wish to specify which records need to be displayed (such as all students with GPAs greater than 3.3). If you wish to display all the rows (records) in the table, then you don’t use the WHERE statement (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.21</span>).</p>
							<p class="start">Suppose you want to create a phone list that includes all students from the Student Information table in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.21a</span>. The SQL query you would send to the database would look like this:</p>
							<p class="TMargin15 BMargin15">SELECT (FirstName, LastName, CellPhone)<br/>FROM (Student Information Table)</p>
							<p class="start"><span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">Figure 11.21b</span> shows the output from this query.</p>
							<p class="start">What if you want a phone list that shows only students from Massachusetts? In that case, you would add a WHERE statement to the query, as follows:</p>
							<p class="TMargin15 BMargin15">SELECT (FirstName, LastName, CellPhone)<br/>FROM (Student Information Table)<br/>WHERE (State = MA)</p>
							<p class="start">This query restricts the output to students who live in Massachusetts, as shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.21c</span>. Notice that the “State” field in the “Student Information” table can be used by the query (in this case, as a limiting criterion) but that the contents of the “State” field aren’t required to be displayed in the query results. This explains why the output shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.21c</span> doesn’t show the “State” field.</p>
							<p class="start">When you want to extract data that is in two or more tables, you use a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>join query</span>. The query actually links (or joins) the two tables using the common field in both tables and extracts the relevant data from each. The format for a simple join query for two tables is as follows:</p>
							<p class="TMargin15">SELECT (Field Name 1, Field Name 2)<br/>FROM (Table 1 Name, Table 2 Name)<br/>WHERE (Table 1 Name.Common Field Name = Table</p>
							<p class="start BMargin15">2 Name.Common Field Name)<br/>AND (Selection Criteria)</p>
							<p class="start">Notice how similar this is to a select query, although the FROM statement must now contain two table names. In a join query, the WHERE statement is split into two parts. In the first part (right after WHERE), the relation between the two tables is defined by identifying the common fields between the tables. The second part of the statement (after AND) is where the selection criteria are defined.</p>
							<p class="start">The AND means that both parts of the statement must be true for the query to produce results (i.e., the two related fields must exist and the selection criteria must be valid). <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(2)">Figure 11.22</span> illustrates using a join query for the “Student Information” and “Roster Master” tables to produce a class roster for students.</p>

				<div class="content"><div class="columnContain">

						<div class="innerColLeft">
							<p>Suppose you manufacture T-shirts, and to keep costs low, you’d like to explore Vietnamese T-shirt manufacturers. You could use the terms “Vietnamese t-shirt manufacturers” in a search engine and you’d probably find many leads. The information in the leads available online may be factually correct, but how do you determine how reliable these suppliers are? Alibaba and Panjiva are two online business-to-business databases that help to navigate these transactions.</p>
					  		<p class="start">Developed to respond to business needs, Alibaba (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://alibaba.com','_blank')">alibaba.com</span>) is one of the world’s largest online business-to-business databases (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.26</span>). Alibaba.com specializes in matching suppliers with buyers for all types of manufactured goods and raw materials. With the global nature of business, databases such as those maintained by Alibaba are essential tools that assist businesspeople in managing their global businesses. </p>
					  		<p class="start">Panjiva (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://panjiva.com','_blank')">panjiva.com</span>) is a website that also has a searchable database, this one of over 1.5 million suppliers. The founders of Panjiva decided to make their database different. They gather data that indicates the reliability of suppliers from sources such as government agencies, independent certification companies, nonprofit organizations, and customers. Using the reliability information, Panjiva then creates ratings for companies (on a scale of 1 to 100) based on specific business performance criteria such as number of shipments to the U.S. market, the company’s environmental record, and their capability to deliver shipments within promised time frames. Companies such as The Home Depot that subscribe to Panjiva’s database can feel more comfortable about doing business with suppliers that Panjiva has rated for reliability.</p>
							<p class="start">Databases with enhanced information are the wave of the future in the business world. So, before you make that next crucial business decision, ask yourself how much you really know about your prospective business partner. If you don’t know enough, then find a database that can make you feel more at ease.</p>

							<p>An offshoot of expert systems are the virtual agents that you encounter on the web or on the phone. Virtual agents are frequently used to interface with a database to answer customers’ questions. For example, a typical virtual agent on the web features a picture, a name, and a box for entering questions, as shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">Figure 11.32</span>. No virtual agent can be programmed to contain all the possible questions a human might ask. Therefore, the virtual agent software breaks the question down into key words and phrases, which it compares to a database containing question responses. It picks the most likely response and provides the answer. Customers provide feedback as to whether the response adequately answered their question. Usually, if results from the virtual agent aren’t satisfactory or if customers need more information, they can connect to a live customer service agent. Virtual agents, although not perfect, save companies mone by answering common questions without using expensive human labor.</p>

				<div class="headerText font_18 shiftUp10">Data, Data Everywhere—<br/>But Is It Protected?</div>

				<div class="content"><div class="columnContain">
				  <div class="column">
					<div class="innerColLeft">
						<p>As databases have become commonplace, an ever-increasing amount of information about you and your habits has been placed into various databases. Consider the following:</p>
						<ul class="dotted leftPadding13">
							<li><span class="innerLi">Every credit card purchase generates a record of that transaction, and both the merchant from whom you purchased the item and the credit card company have gathered information about your buying habits (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.additionalPopupContent(1)">see Figure 11.34</span>). In March 2012, private customer information was improperly exposed from all the major credit card brands, potentially affecting millions of credit card holders.</span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Automated highway toll records are routinely subpoenaed in court cases. For example, toll records were used in an Illinois court by a husband in a 2007 divorce case to prove his wife was rarely home and therefore unfit to have custody of their son.</span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Many companies such as Target collect e-mail addresses so they can correspond with customers, but the e-mails don’t come directly from those companies. Large marketing companies such as Epsilon are hired to manage customer e-mail programs. Unfortunately, in March 2011 Epsilon’s database servers suffered an attack that exposed millions of individuals’ e-mail addresses to hackers.</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="start">Inadvertently exposing information to inappropriate or unauthorized individuals is known as a <em>data breach</em>. What responsibility do companies have in safeguarding your data? Should they inform you that your data might be shared with other corporations and obtain your permission before sharing it? How should consumers be compensated (and by whom) if their data is misused?</p>
					  	
						<h2 class="blueHeading TMargin15">What Can You Do?</h2>
						<p>Providing information and having it recorded in databases are part of our way of life now. Because refusing to give information out at all is bound to be impractical, ask the following questions related to data you’re providing:</p>
						<ul class="dotted leftPadding13 strong">
							<li><span class="innerLi">For what purpose is the data being gathered?<span class="notStrong"> When the clerk at the electronics superstore asks for your zip code, ask why he or she wants it.</span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Are the reasons for gathering the data legitimate or important to you?<span class="notStrong"> You might not want to share your information for marketing purposes, but might want to in order to initiate a product warranty. Similarly, disclosing personal information to your pharmacist may be important for receiving good care and therefore is important to you. If you don’t see the advantage, then ask more questions or don’t reveal the information.</span></span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">How will the collected information be protected?<span class="notStrong"> Ask about data protection policies before you give information. Most websites provide access to their data protection policies when they ask you for information. If an organization doesn’t have a data protection policy, be wary of giving them sensitive information. Data protection doesn’t just refer to keeping data secure, it also means restricting access to the data to employees of the organization that need to use that data. A shipping clerk might need to see your address, for example, but doesn’t need to see your credit card information.</span></span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Will the collected information be used for purposes other than the purpose for which it was originally collected?<span class="notStrong innerLi"> This might be covered in a data protection policy. If it isn’t, ask about it. Will your information be sold to or shared with other companies? Will it be used for marketing other products to you?</span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Could the information asked for be used for identity theft? <span class="notStrong innerLi">Identity thieves usually need your Social Security number and your birth date to open credit card accounts in your name. Be especially wary when asked for this information, and make sure there is a legitimate need for it. Most organizations and businesses are shying away from using Social Security numbers to track customers because of the risk of identity theft. And do you really need an e-mail from someone on your birthday advertising a product? It really isn’t worth exposing your birth date to potential misuse.</span></li>
							<li><span class="innerLi">Are organizations safeguarding your data?<span class="notStrong"> Don’t just consider new requests for information. Think about organizations, such as banks, that already have your information. Have they been in the news lately because of a major data breach? (Is your bank a customer of Epsilon, for instance?) You might want to consider switching institutions if yours has a poor record of data security.</span></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="start">Think carefully before providing information and be vigilant about monitoring your data when you can. It may make the difference between invasion of privacy and peace of mind.</p>
