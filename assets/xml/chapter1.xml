					<p class="moreSpacing">At the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, researcher Dr. Anthony Atala heads a group working on more than 30 different projects developing <strong>human tissues and organs</strong>. One project uses ordinary desktop <strong>printers</strong> to create human organs! Instead of using ink, the printers "bioprint" with <strong>human cells</strong>, layer after layer. In about 40 minutes they can "print" a two-chamber heart, which starts beating on its own about 5 hours later. One of these portable printers would be able to create skin onsite for people with life-threatening burns. Currently, the printers are still experimental, but there is great hope for advances that combine medicine and technology to repair our own bodies.</p>

					<div class="HeadingGreenBackDiagDashes">How Will You Put Technology in Action?</div>
					<p class="digCompP">Ask yourself: Why are you in this class? Maybe it's a requirement for your degree, or maybe you want to improve your computer skills. But let's step back and look at the bigger picture.</p>
					<p class="digCompP start">Technology today is not just a means for career advancement or merely a skill set needed to survive in society. It's a tool that enables us all to make an impact beyond our own lives. We've all seen the movies that dangle the dream in front of us of being the girl or guy who saves the worldâ€”and gets to drive a nice car while doing it! Whether it's <em>Transformers</em> or <em>Spider-Man</em>, we are drawn to heroes because we want our work and our lives to mean something and to benefit others.</p>
					<p class="digCompP start">Technology can be your ticket to doing just that, to influencing and participating in projects that will change the world. We'd like to ask you to think about how your talents and skills in technology will let you contribute on a larger scale, beyond the benefits they will bring to you personally.</p>

					<p>Recent political and global issues are showing that technology is accelerating change around the world and galvanizing groups of people in new ways. Let's look at a few examples.</p>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Political Issues</h2>
					<p><strong>Egypt.</strong> At the end of 2010, a series of revolutions took place across the Arab and North African regions fueled by social networking tools like Facebook and Twitter. These <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>social networking</span> tools enable the gathering together </p>

					<p>of groups of people to connect and exchange ideas, and they brought together people facing repression and censorship in many countries in this region.</p>
					<p class="start">The powerful uprising in Egypt is one example of the impact an individual armed with an understanding of modern technology can have. The reigning government in Egypt had been in power for over 30 years. In June 2010, after Egyptian businessman Khaled Said was killed by authorities, Wael Ghonim, a Google marketing manager in Egypt, anonymously launched the Facebook page "We Are All Khaled Said." The Facebook page became a tool that made people aware there were others who were dissatisfied with the direction of the country. By January 2011, the government responded to the increasing unrest online by "turning off" Egypt's Internet. The government told the four largest Internet providers to shut down and thus closed access to 93 percent of Egyptian networks. Protests against this shutdown turned violent, and Egyptian Internet providers began to restore service a few days later.</p>
					<p class="start">Back in the virtual world of Facebook and Twitter, thousands offered ideas on how they could protest meaningfully. Finally, a silent gathering near the sea in Alexandria, Egypt, was chosen. This movement from "virtual community" to physical community (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(4,0)">see Figure 1.1</span>) was a turning point, and in February 2011, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt resigned.</p>

					<p class=" start TMargin5">Social networking tools are providing a level of instant connection and information distribution that is reshaping the world. For Wael Ghonim, it led to an opportunity to recast the future of his country. What can you do with social networking tools that will change the future of your community?</p>
					<br/>
					<p><strong>Kenya.</strong> Another example of technology influencing society recently occurred in Kenya. In December 2007, the closest election in Kenya's history ended with the current president declaring victory despite allegations of electoral fraud. Nairobi lawyer Ory Okolloh began to get messages describing acts of violence occurring all over the country. She tried to post the messages on her blog, <em>KenyanPundit</em>, but was quickly overwhelmed. She put out a request for help through the blog.</p>

					<p class="start">Within 72 hours, two programmers, Erik Hersman and Juliana Rotich, had created Ushahidi (Swahili for "testimony"). It is a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>crisis-mapping tool</span> that collects information from e-mails, text messages, blog posts, and Twitter tweets and then maps them, instantly making the information publicly available. The developers then made Ushahidi a free platform anyone in the world can use. To date, it has been used during the earthquakes and tsunami in Japan, to battle election violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to help people in Somalia have a voice, and to make it easier to locate the nearest store that supports Fair Trade practices (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(4,1)">Figure 1.2</span>). In what other ways could technology help us face times of crisis?</p>

				<p>Political crises are not the only arena in which technology is enabling <br/>global change.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><strong>The Digital Divide.</strong> There is a great gap between the levels of Internet access and the availability of technical tools in different regions of the world. The term coined for this difference in ease of access to technology is the <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>digital divide</span>. One danger of a digital divide is that it prevents us from using all the minds on the planet to solve the planet's problems. But this challenge created by technology is also being answered by technology.</p>
				<p class="start">The <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://www.nexteinstein.org/','_blank')">Next Einstein Initiative (NEI)</span> is a plan to focus resources on the talented mathematical minds of Africa (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(5,3)">see Figure 1.3</span>). By expanding the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) across the continent, the future of Africa can be profoundly changed. Cambridge professor Neil Turok founded AIMS to bring together the brightest young minds across Africa with the best lecturers in the world. The NEI has won funding from Google's Project 10<sup>100</sup>, an initiative to award $10 million to a set of five projects, selected by open public voting. By capturing the enthusiasm of the world with presentations distributed through TED (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://ted.com','_blank')">ted.com</span>) and Project 10<sup>100</sup></span>, there is now a push to create 15 additional AIMS centers across Africa.</p>

					<p>Technology is also allowing us to redefine very fundamental parts of our social makeupâ€”how we think, how we connect with each other, and how we purchase and consume products.</p>
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Technology Impacts How We Think</h2>
					<p><strong>What We Think About.</strong> What do you think about in your free time? In the late twentieth century, a common trend was to think about what to buy nextâ€”or perhaps what to watch or listen to next. Information and products were being served up at an amazing rate, and a pattern of consumption became habit. As more and more web applications began to appear that allowed each individual to become a "creator" of the web, a new kind of Internet came into being. It was nicknamed <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Web 2.0</span>, and it had a set of new features and functionality that allowed users to contribute content easily and to be easily connected to each other. Now everyone could collaborate internationally at the click of a mouse.</p>
					<p class="start">Web 2.0 has fostered a dramatic shift across the world from simply consuming to having the ability to volunteer and collaborate on projects. In his book <em>Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age,</em> author Clay Shirky created the term <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>cognitive surplus</span> to mean the </p>

				<p>combination of leisure time and the tools to be creative. The world's population has an estimated one trillion hours a year of free time. When coupled with the available media tools and the easy connectivity of Web 2.0, and with generosity and a need to share, projects like Ushahidi and the Witness Project (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(5,1)">see Figure 1.4</span>) emerge.</p>
				<p class="start">But why would anyone bother to work on projects like these in their free time? Modern theories of motivation show that what pushes people to apply their free time in altruistic causes, for no money, is the excitement of autonomy, mastery, and purpose (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(6,1)">see Figure 1.6</span>):</p>

				<h2 class="blueHeading noTMargin">Technology Impacts How We Connect</h2>
				<p class="lessSpacing rightPadding20"><strong>Connecting Through Music.</strong> In many societies, people connect intimately in gatherings and local celebrations through shared experiences. Technology like classical composer and conductor Eric Whitacre's Virtual Choir has added breadth to this aspect of our lives. Whitacre began the idea of a virtual choir by posting to YouTube a video of himself conducting one of his works, "Lux Aurumque." The idea was that listeners would follow his lead and, as they heard the piano track, each would record their part of the piece as either a soprano, an alto, a tenor, or a bass. The submitted videos were edited together, the audio was aligned, and the first piece from the Virtual Choir was released, with 50 recorded voices. A blog connects the members of the choir and builds a real sense of community between members. A glance at the Virtual Choir Map (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://ericwhitacre.com/the-virtual-choir/map','_blank')">ericwhitacre.com/the-virtual-choir/map</span>) shows the physical location of each voice (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(7,0)">see Figure 1.7</span>).</p>

				<p class="lessSpacing"><strong>Connecting Through Business.</strong> One of the most profound ways we can connect with each other is to support other people's dreams. Kickstarter (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://kickstarter.com','_blank')">kickstarter.com</span>) helps us connect in this way by allowing people to post their ideas for community projects, games, and inventions and to ask for funding directly. Donors are given rewards for different levels of pledges, such as a signed edition of a book or a special color of a product. This style of generating capital to start a business is known as <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>crowdfunding</span>, asking for small donations from a large number of people, often using the Internet.</p>
				<br/>
				<h2 class="blueHeading noTMargin">Technology Impacts How We Consume</h2>
				<p>Technology is changing all aspects of how we purchase and consume goodsâ€”from strategies for convincing you to purchase a certain product to the mechanics of how you buy and own things.</p>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/images/pics/smallScan.jpg" style="float:right;margin-right:13px; margin-top: 9px;" onclick="window.open('http://ted.com','_blank')" />
				<p class="lessSpacing"><strong>Marketing.</strong> New strategies in marketing are counting on the fact that most people have a cell phone with a camera and Internet access. A technology called <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>QR (quick response) codes</span> lets any piece of print host a link to online information and video content. From your smartphone, simply run your QR app and hold the phone near the QR image anywhere you see itâ€”like the one you see here and on page 3 of this chapter. Your phone scans the QR image and then a website, video, schedule, or Facebook page for more information about the product.</p>

				<p class="start">Marketers also have to be aware of the phenomenon of <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>crowdsourcing</span>â€”checking in with the voice of the crowd. Consumers are using apps like MobileVoice to check people's verdicts on the quality of items. Forward-thinking companies are using this input to improve their products and services. AT&T, for example, has an app that lets customers report locations of coverage gaps.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><strong>Access Versus Ownership.</strong> Even the idea of ownership is evolving thanks to new technologies. Items like cars and bikes can become "subscriptions" instead of large one-time purchases. For example, ZipCar allows hundreds of thousands of people to use shared cars, and Call a Bike is a popular bike-renting program in Germany. With ZipCar, a phone call or online reservation activates your personal ZipCard. This card allows you to automatically open the door of the car you have reserved, and away you drive. GPS technology is used to track where the car is, whether it has been dropped off at the right location, and how far it has been driven. In Germany, racks of Call a Bikes are located at major street corners in large cities (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(8,0)">see Figure 1.8</span>). Simply call the phone number printed on the bike and it texts you a code to unlock the bike. When you're done riding the bike, simply relock it and you're billed automatically.</p>

We are so constantly connected with each other that we have again found the power of community. There are increasing opportunities to redistribute the things we have purchased and to share the services a product provides instead of owning it outright. Add in the pressure of mounting environmental concerns and a global financial crisis, and we are migrating toward collaborative consumption.</p>

					<p class="digCompP">Technology is creating huge changes in the world as well as in how we behave socially, but it is also important to you on a more personal level. Being <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>computer literate</span> means being familiar enough with computers that you understand their capabilities and limitations and that you know how to use them safely and efficiently.

Do you know what all the words in the ad mean? What is RAM? What is a CPU? What are MB, GB, GHz, and cache? How fast do you need your computer to be, and how much memory should it have? If you're computer literate, you'll be a more informed consumer when it comes time to buy computers, peripherals, and technology services. Understanding computer terminology and keeping current with technology will help you better determine which computers and devices you need.</p>

					<p><span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Information technology (IT)</span> is a field of study focused on the management and processing of information and the automatic retrieval of information. IT careers include working with computers, telecommunications, and software deployment. Career opportunities in IT are on the rise, but no matter what career you choose, new technology in the workplace is creating a demand for new skill levels in technology from employees. A study from the National Research Council concludes that by the year 2030, computers will displace humans in 60 percent of current occupations. Having advanced skills is becoming more critical every year.</p>

				<p>location. In addition to inventory control systems, which help managers figure out how much merchandise they need to order to replace stock that is sold, managers can use mined data to determine that if they want a certain product to sell well, they must lower its priceâ€”especially if they cut the price at one store and see sales increase, for example. Data mining thus allows retailers to respond to consumer buying patterns.</p>
				<p class="start">Have you ever wondered how Amazon or Netflix suggests items that fit your taste? Or how such websites automatically display lists of items people bought after they ordered the camera you just picked out? Data mining can keep track of the purchases customers make, along with their geographic data, past buying history, and lists of items they looked at but did not purchase. This data can be translated into marketing that is customized to your shopping. This is the motivation behind the discount cards grocery stores and drugstores offer. In exchange for tracking your buying habits, they offer you special pricing. In the age of data mining, you may be using its capabilities in a number of careers.</p>

Courses are designed around course management software such as Blackboard or Moodle so that students can communicate outside of class, take quizzes online, and find their class materials easily. The Internet has obvious advantages in the classroom as a research tool for students, and effective use of the Internet allows teachers to expose students to places students otherwise couldn't access. There are simulations and instructional software programs on the web that are incredible learning tools. For example, teachers can employ these products to give students a taste of running a global business (<span class="strongDBlue"  onclick="compTia.togglePopup(15,0)">see Figure 1.13</span>) or the experience of the Interactive Body (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody','_blank')">bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody</span>).</p>

In fact, a law enforcement specialty called computer forensics is growing in importance in order to fight modern crime. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Computer forensics</span> analyzes computer systems with specific techniques to gather potential legal evidence. For example, Steven Zirko was recently convicted for two Chicago-area murders based on computer forensics work. Computer forensics examiners trained by the FBI scoured Zirko's computer and located searches for terms like <em>hire a hitman</em> and <em>GHB</em>, the date-rape drug. Zirko had also used his computer to find the daily schedule for his victim's two school-aged children and to get directions to her home. In many cases, files, videos, and conversations conducted using a computer can be recovered by forensics specialists and can be used as evidence of criminal activity.</p>

				<p class="start lessSpacing">One type of chip is already being implanted in humans as a means of verifying a person's identity. Called VeriMed, this personal identification chip is about the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the skin.

				<p class="start">Currently, nonimplant versions of identity chips are used in hospitals. When chips are attached with bands to newborn infants, the hospital staff can instantly monitor the location of any baby. Elevators and doors are designed to allow only certain people to enter with a specific baby, even if hospital power is interrupted. Although the use of implantable tags is becoming more commonplace, it remains to be seen whether people will decide that the advantages of having their medical data quickly available justifies having chips implanted in their bodies. As a doctor, would you advise your patients to use an implantable chip?</p>

A career as a psychologist may take you into an exciting exploration of the boundaries between the nature of being human and the nature of machines.</p>

Most computers you are familiar with can perform calculations and do the tasks they are programmed for much faster than humans can, but they fail miserably at telling a good joke or modifying their behavior based on your frustration. This wide gap in the computing abilities of computers versus their emotional abilities is the target of research in affective computing.</p>

				<li><span class="innerLi">Computer Literacy</span><br/><span class="innerLi lineSpacing17 notStrong">In your academic career, you'll be spending time understanding the requirements of the degree program you choose. At many schools, computer literacy requirements exist either as incoming requirements (skills students must have before they're admitted) or as outgoing requirements (skills students must prove they have before graduating). Does your program require specific computer skills? Which skills are they? Should they be required? How can students efficiently prove that they have these skills? How often does the set of skills need to be reviewed and updated?</span></li>
				<li><span class="innerLi">The Mind of the Mob</span><br/><span class="innerLi lineSpacing17 notStrong">Crowdsourcing is the gathering of data in real time, as an event happens, from a growing crowd of people. Because of the large number of students who now own phones with Internet access, crowdsourcing on campus could start to be useful. In what settings would making decisions based on information from a gathering crowd on campus be valuable? How would you react to your professor using a form of crowdsourcing to determine your grade on an essay?</span></li>
				<li><span class="innerLi">Recycle, Repair, Redistribute</span><br/><span class="innerLi lineSpacing17 notStrong">The Microsoft-authorized refurbisher program and TechSoup both help provide resources to people in need to reduce the barrier of the digital divide. These organizations recycle hardware and supply software inexpensively to needy families. How could a program be set up at your school to make people aware of these options? Could students donate materials or retrofit systems as part of their coursework? As part of a club activity? How could you make these programs work for your community?</span></il>

				<li><span class="innerLi">Patients and Medical Computing</span><br/><span class="innerLi notStrong">As more hospitals and doctors' offices begin to use electronic medical records (EMRs), the flow of information among the doctors and care facilities a patient uses could become much more reliable. In their training and work, doctors and nurses rely on computers. What about patients? Examine Microsoft Health Vault at <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault','_blank')">microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault</span> for an example of an electronic medical history. How does this migration from a traditional paper records system impact the skills required for medical office workers? New ethical questions also often arise when technology changes. How would a medical facility now protect and verify its data records? What risks are there with a product like the Microsoft Health Vault?</span></li>
				<li><span class="innerLi">Social Media Careers</span><br/><span class="innerLi notStrong">With the explosion of users on social media sites, businesses need to establish their presence on social media sites. Just search for "Vans" or "Starbucks" on Facebook for examples of company sites. To manage their interaction with customers (and fans), companies need to hire social media managers. Using a job site such as Monster.com, search for â€š"social media manager" and review the job postings. What are the educational requirements for social media managers? What technical skills do these jobs require? Given your major, what companies would you do well for as a social media manager? What steps should you take while in school to prepare yourself for a career as a social media manager?</span></li>

		<h3>A Culture of Sharing</h3>
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p>As more and more peer-to-peer music-sharing services appeared, like BitTorrent and LimeWire, many felt a culture of theft was developing. Some argued there was a mindset that property rights for intellectual works need not be respected and that people should be able to download, for free, any music, movies, or other digital content they wanted.</p>
			<p class="start">But there is another view of the phenomenon. Some are suggesting that the amount of constant access to other people-through texting, e-mail, blogging, and the easy exchange of digital content-has created a culture of trust and sharing. This Team Time will explore both sides of this debate as it affects three different parts of our lives-finance, travel, and consumerism.</p>
		]]>

	<section>
		<![CDATA[
		<h4>Task</h4>
		<p>Each of three groups will select a different area to examine-finance, travel, or consumerism. The groups will find evidence to support or refute the idea that a culture of sharing is developing. The finance group will want to explore projects like Kickstarter (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://kickstarter.com','_blank')">kickstarter.com</span>) and Kiva (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://kiva.org','_blank')">kiva.org</span>). The travel group should examine what is happening with CouchSurfing (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://couchsurfing.org','_blank')">couchsurfing.org</span>) to start their research. The team investigating consumerism will want to look at goods-exchange programs like Freecycle (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://freecycle.org','_blank')">freecycle.org</span>).</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Process</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="notStrong">Divide the class into three teams.</span></li>
			<li><span class="notStrong">Discuss the different views of a "culture of sharing." With the other members of your team, use the Internet to research up-and-coming technologies and projects that would support your position. People use social media tools to connect into groups to exchange ideas. Does that promote trust? Does easy access to digital content promote theft, or has the value of content changed? Are there other forces like the economy and the environmental state of the world that play a role in promoting a culture of sharing? What evidence can you find to support your ideas?</span></li>
			<li><span class="notStrong">Present your group's findings to the class for debate and discussion.</span></li>
			<li><span class="notStrong">Write a strategy paper that summarizes your position and outlines your predictions for the future. Will the pace of technology promote a change in the future from the position you are describing?</span></li>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>The future of technology is unknown, but we do know that it will impact the way our society progresses. To be part of the developments that technology will bring will take good planning and attention, no matter what area of the culture you're examining. Begin nowÃ³learn how to stay on top of technology.</p>

			<h4>Should Information Be Free?</h4>
			<p >In this exercise, you'll research and role-play a complicated ethical situation. The role you play might not match your personal beliefs; regardless, your research and use of logic should enable you to represent the view assigned. An arbitrator will watch and comment on both sides of the arguments, and together, team members will agree on an ethical solution.</p>
		
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p>The crisis-mapping tool Ushahidi has been used to collect and present information in times of unrest. This allows everyone to be involved in gathering the actual facts about what is happening and to help address the needs of people who are lost and hurt.</p>
			<p class="start">WikiLeaks is another example of a tool that gathers information and "frees" it by presenting it to the public. Whistleblowers and secret and classified media have been exposed to the world community through publication via WikiLeaks. However, some people feel that WikiLeaks has endangered people by revealing information that should have been kept confidential.</p>

			<p class="start">What is the nature of information? Should it be "free"â€”available without censure or government controls? Is there a limitâ€”should only certain information be free, whereas other information should be kept away from the public for the greater good?</p>
			
			<h4>Research Topics to Consider</h4>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Electronic Frontier Foundation</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Government 2.0</span>
			
			<h4>Process</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Divide the class into teams. Each team will select a web-based tool that allows us access to information.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should each think of a situation where a person would benefit from the easy access to information and a situation where it might be undesirable.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should arrange a mutually convenient time to meet and exchange ideas, using either the chat room feature of <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://www.myitlab.com','_blank')">MyITLab</span> or the discussion board feature of your course management software or by meeting in person. Select the most-powerful and bestconstructed arguments and develop a summary conclusion.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should present their findings to the class or submit a PowerPoint presentation for review by the rest of the class, along with the summary conclusion they developed.</span></li>
			</ol>	
			
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>As technology becomes ever more prevalent and integrated into our lives, ethical dilemmas will present themselves to an increasing extent. Being able to understand and evaluate both sides of the argument, while responding in a personally or socially ethical manner, will be an important skill.</p>
