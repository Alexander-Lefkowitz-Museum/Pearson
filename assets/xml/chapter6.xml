					<p class="moreSpacing">Just like the car industry has special concept cars, at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, Intel showed off a glimpse into what your <strong>next computer</strong> may look like, the Nikiski ultrabook. A <strong>transparent track pad</strong> flows across the full length of the machine, so when closed you can still see through to key information like your to-do list, in-box, Facebook, and meeting notes. It also works as a <strong>touchpad interface</strong> so that you can select and respond to important information <strong>without opening the tablet</strong>.</p>
					<p class="moreSpacing">Once you do open the cover, the inside surface of the transparent touchpad acts as a <strong>huge track pad</strong>. It understands the difference between the weight of your wrists or palms and your fingertips and only processes the glide of your fingertips as you scroll or pinch and zoom. Folks were storming the stage after the presentation to get a look at this cool device!</p>

					<p class="digCompP">It can be tough to know if your computer is the best match for your needs. New technologies emerge so quickly, and it’s hard to determine whether these are expensive extras or tools you need. Do you need USB 3.0 instead of USB 2.0? Doesn’t it always seem like your friend’s computer is faster than yours anyway? Maybe you could get more out of newer technologies, but should you upgrade the system you have or buy a new machine? In this chapter, you’ll learn how to measure your system’s performance and gauge your needs so that you end up with a system you love.</p>

					<p><strong>When is the best time to buy a new computer?</strong> There never seems to be a perfect time to buy. It seems that if you can just wait a year, computers will be faster and cost less. But is this actually true?</p>
					
					<p class="start">As it turns out, it is true. In fact, a rule of thumb often cited in the computer industry called <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Moore’s Law</span> describes the pace at which central processing units (CPUs) improve. Named for Gordon Moore, the cofounder of the CPU chip manufacturer Intel, this rule predicts that the number of transistors inside a CPU will increase so fast that CPU capacity will double about every 2 years. (The number of transistors on a CPU chip helps determine how fast it can process data.)</p>
					<p class="start">This rule of thumb has held true for over 45 years. <span class="strongDBlue"  onclick="compTia.togglePopup(3,0)">Figure 6.1</span> shows a way to visualize this kind of exponential growth. If CPU capacity were put into terms of population growth, a group of 2,300 people at the start of CPU </p>

					<p>development would now be a country of over one billion! Moore himself has predicted that around the year 2020, CPU chips will be manufactured in a different way, thus changing or eliminating the effects of Moore’s Law altogether.</p>
					<p class="start">In addition to the CPU becoming faster, other system components also continue to improve dramatically. For example, the capacity of memory chips such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM)—the most common form of memory found in personal computers—increases about 60% every year. Meanwhile, hard drives have been growing in storage capacity by some 50% each year.</p>

					<p class="start"><strong>OK, things change fast. How do I know what’s best for me?</strong> Consider what kind of user you are and what needs you have.

					<p class="moreSpacing">for word processing and Internet access? Are you on the move and need to bring your computer with you everywhere? <span class="strongDBlue"  onclick="compTia.togglePopup(4,0)"> Figure 6.2</span> shows a few different types of users—which type (or types) are you?</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">Now ask yourself, does your current computer match your needs? As we evaluate the pieces of your system, it’ll become clear whether you need a few upgrades or perhaps a new machine better matched to you.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How do I pick from all the types of computers available?</strong></p>
					<p>A huge number of choices are on the market:</p>
					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi">Tablets (like the iPad or Galaxy)</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Ultrabooks (like the MacBook Air)</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Netbooks (which have a screen smaller than 10 inches and a small keyboard)</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Tablet PCs (which have a touch-enabled screen and  a full keyboard)</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Laptops (or notebooks)</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Desktops</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="start moreSpacing">The main distinction between the available options is based on your need for mobility versus your need for processing power. If you’re on the move all the time and have to have the lightest solution possible, an ultrabook may be best for you. At less than 3 pounds, they’re great on weight but don’t include an optical drive for CDs/DVDs or much storage space. Even lighter are tablets like the iPad, but they also lack optical drives and may not be able to run all the software you need.</p>

					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Why would I consider buying a desktop?</strong> Desktop systems are invariably a better value than lighter, more mobile computers. You’ll find you get more computing power for your dollar, and you’ll have more opportunity to upgrade parts of your system later. In addition, desktops often ship with a 24-inch or larger monitor, whereas lighter computers offer screens between 10 and 17 inches.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">Desktop systems are also more reliable. Because of the vibration that a laptop experiences and the added exposure to dust, water, and temperature fluctuations that portability brings, laptops often have a shorter lifespan than desktop computers. You’ll have less worry over theft or loss with a desktop, too. Manufacturers do offer extended warranty plans that cover laptop computers for accidental damage and theft; however, such plans can be costly.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How long should I plan on keeping my computer?</strong> You should be able to count on 2 years, and maybe even 4 or 5 years. The answer depends in part on how easy it is to upgrade your system. Take note of the maximum amount of memory you can install in your device. Also, check whether you can upgrade your device’s graphics capabilities down the road.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">Laptops are often equipped with an <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>ExpressCard</span> slot. ExpressCards (<span class="strongDBlue"  onclick="compTia.togglePopup(5,0)">shown in Figure 6.3</span>) can add a solid-state drive (SSD), new kinds of ports, and other capabilities to your system. This gives you a way to make sure </p>

					<p clas="moreSpacing">your laptop doesn’t become obsolete before its time. However, note that the lighter ultrabooks and tablets don’t have ExpressCard expansion options.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How can I tell if my current system is good enough?</strong> We’ll begin by conducting a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>system evaluation</span>. To do this, we’ll look at your computer’s subsystems, see what they do, and check how they perform during your typical workday. Then we’ll compare that with what is available on the market, and the path forward for you will become clearer. Even if you’re not in the market for a new computer, conducting a system evaluation will help you understand what you might want in a new system down the road.</p>

					<h2 class="blueHeading">How the CPU Works</h2>
					<p class="morespacing"><strong>How does the CPU actually work?</strong> The CPU is composed of two units: the <em>control unit</em> and the <em>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</em>. The control unit coordinates the activities of all the other computer components. The ALU is responsible for performing all the arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It also makes logic and comparison decisions such as comparing items to determine if one is greater than, less than, or equal to another.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">Every time the CPU performs a program instruction, it goes through the same series of steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><span class="innerLi">It <em>fetches</em> the required piece of data or instruction from random access memory (RAM), the temporary storage location for all the data and instructions the computer needs while it’s running.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">It <em>decodes</em> the instruction into something the computer can understand.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">It <em>executes</em> the instruction.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">It <em>stores</em> the result to RAM before fetching the next instruction.</span></li>
					</ol>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">This process is called a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="machine cycle (processing cycle)">machine cycle</span>. (We discuss the machine cycle in more detail in the <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.moveTo(7,42,0)">Technology in Focus feature “Under the Hood.”</span>)</p>

					<p>processing power. A CPU’s processing power is determined by the  following:</p>
					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi">Its <em>clock speed</em></span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Whether it has multiple <em>cores</em></span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Its amount of <em>cache memory</em></span></li>
					</ul>	
					
					<p class="start"><strong>How does a CPU with a higher clock speed help me?</strong> The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>clock speed</span> of a CPU dictates how many instructions the CPU can process each second. It is measured in gigahertz (GHz), or billions of steps per second. The faster the clock speed, the more quickly the next instruction is processed. CPUs currently have clock speeds between 2.1 and 4 GHz. There is a huge difference between a computer with a 2.1 GHz CPU and one with a 4 GHz CPU.</p>
					<p class="start">Some users push their hardware to perform faster, <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>overclocking</span> their processor. Overclocking means that you run the CPU at a faster speed than the manufacturer recommends. It produces more heat, meaning a shorter lifetime for the CPU, and usually voids any warranty, but in gaming systems, you’ll see this done quite often.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>How does a multi-core CPU help me?</strong> A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>core</span> on a CPU contains the parts of the CPU required for processing. As shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(8,0)">Figure 6.6a</span>, with multiple-core technology, two or more complete processors live on the same chip, enabling the independent execution of two sets of instructions at the same time.

					<p>behind the scenes, such as virus protection software and your operating system (OS), can have their own dedicated processor, freeing the other processors to run other applications more efficiently. This results in faster processing and smoother multitasking.</p>
					<p class="start">CPUs began to execute more than one instruction at a time when <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>hyperthreading</span> was introduced in 2002.

					<p class="start"><strong>How does more cache memory help me?</strong> The CPU’s <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>cache memory</span> is a form of RAM that gets data to the CPU for processing much faster than bringing the data in from the computer’s RAM. There are three levels of cache memory, defined by their proximity to the CPU:</p>
					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Level 1 cache</em> is a block of memory built on the CPU chip itself for storage of data or commands that have just been used. That gets the data to the CPU blindingly fast!</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Level 2 cache</em> is located on the CPU chip but is slightly farther away and so takes somewhat longer to access than Level 1 cache. It contains more storage area than Level 1 cache.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Level 3 cache</em> is slower for the CPU to reach but is larger in size than Level 2 cache.</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The more expensive the CPU, the more cache memory it will have.</p>
					
					<p class="start"><strong>So how do I shop for a CPU?</strong> You’ll often see models of the same computer with just a different CPU varying in cost by $200 or more. Is the price difference worth it? It’s hard to know because so many factors influence CPU performance. Picking the best CPU for the kind of work you do is easier if you research some performance benchmarks. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>CPU benchmarks</span> are measurements used to compare performance between processors.</p>

					<h2 class="blueHeading">Measuring the CPU</h2>
					<p class="moreSpacing"><strong>How can I tell whether my current CPU is meeting my needs?</strong> One way to determine whether your CPU is right for you is to watch how busy it is as you work. You can do this by checking out your <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>CPU usage</span>—the percentage of time your CPU is working.</p> 
					<p class="start">Your computer’s OS has utilities that measure CPU usage. These are incredibly useful, both for considering whether you should upgrade and for investigating if your computer’s performance suddenly seems to drop off for no apparent reason.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">On Windows systems, Task Manager lets you access this data (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(9,1)">see Figure 6.7</span>). The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>CPU usage graph</span> records your CPU usage for the past several seconds. (Note that if you have multiple cores and hyperthreading, you’ll see only one physical processor listed, but it will show that you have several virtual processors.) Of course, there will be periodic peaks of high CPU usage, but if your CPU usage levels are greater than 90% during most of your work session, a faster CPU will contribute a great deal to your system’s performance.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">To walk through using the Task Manager, check out the <span onclick="compTia.switchPage(0,22)" class="strongDBlue">Try This</span> on page 244 and watch the <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/bp/bp_evans_soundbytes_9/using_windows_to_evaluate_cpu_performance/index.html','_blank')">“Using Windows to Evaluate CPU Performance” Sound Byte</span>.

					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How often do I have to be watching the CPU load?</strong> Keep in mind that the workload your CPU experiences depends on how many programs are running at one time. Even though the CPU may meet the specs for each program separately, how you use your machine during a typical day may tax the CPU. If you’re having slow response times or decide to measure CPU performance as a check, open the Task Manager and leave it open for a full day. Check in at points when you have a lot of open windows and when you have a lot of networking or disk-usage demand.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>So a better CPU means a better performing system?</strong> Your CPU affects only the <em>processing</em> portion of the system performance, not how quickly data can move to or from the CPU. Your system’s <em>overall</em>  performance depends on many factors, including the amount of RAM installed as well as hard drive speed. Your selection of CPU may not offer significant improvements to your system’s performance if there is a bottleneck in processing because of insufficient RAM or hard drive performance, so you need to make sure the system is designed in a balanced way. <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(10,0)">Figure 6.8</span> lists factors to consider as you decide which specific CPU is right for you.</p>

Although we refer to RAM as a form of storage, it really is the computer’s short-term memory. It remembers everything that the computer needs in order to process data into information, such as data that has been entered and software instructions, but only when the computer is on. RAM is an example of <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>volatile storage</span>. When the power is off, the data stored in RAM is cleared out. This is why, in addition to RAM, systems always include <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>nonvolatile storage</span> devices for permanent storage of instructions and data. Read-only memory (ROM), for example, holds the critical start-up instructions. Hard drives provide the largest nonvolatile storage capacity in the computer system.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Why not use a hard drive to store the data and instructions?</strong> It’s about one million times faster for the CPU to retrieve a piece of data from RAM than from a mechanical hard drive. The time it takes the CPU to grab data from RAM is measured in nanoseconds (billionths of seconds), whereas pulling data from a fast mechanical hard drive takes an average of 10 milliseconds (ms), or thousandths of seconds.</p>

					<p class="start">It’s a good idea to have more than the minimum amount of RAM you need now so you can use more programs in the future. Remember, too, that “required” means these are the <em>minimum values</em> recommended by manufacturers; having more RAM often helps programs run more efficiently. New systems today ship with at least 4 GB of RAM, and high-end systems can come with 24 GB. The rule of thumb: When buying a new computer, buy as much RAM as you can afford.</p>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Adding RAM</h2>
					<p><strong>Is there a limit to how much RAM I can add to my computer?</strong> The motherboard is designed with a specific number of slots into which the memory cards fit, and each slot has a limit on the amount of RAM it can hold. To determine your specific system limits, check the system manufacturer’s website.</p>
					<p class="start">In addition, the OS running on your machine imposes its own RAM limit. For example, the maximum amount of RAM for the 32-bit version of Windows 8 is 4 GB, whereas the maximum memory you can install using the 64-bit version of Windows 8 Pro is 192 GB.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>Is it difficult or expensive to add RAM?</strong> Adding RAM is fairly easy (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(14,1)">see Figure 6.13</span>).</p>

					<p>Remember, there are two ways data is stored on your computer: temporary storage and permanent storage. RAM is a form of temporary (or volatile) storage. The information residing in RAM is not stored permanently. It’s critical to have the means to store data and software applications permanently.</p>
					<p class="start">Fortunately, several storage options exist. Storage devices include internal hard drives, SSDs, optical drives, and external hard drives. When you turn off your computer, the data that has been written to these devices will be available the next time the machine is powered on. These devices therefore provide <em>nonvolatile</em> storage.</p>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Mechanical Hard Drives</h2>
					<p><strong>What makes the hard drive such a popular storage device?</strong> With storage capacities exceeding 4 terabytes (TB), a mechanical <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="hard disk drive (hdd)">hard drive</span> has the largest capacity of any storage device. And because it offers the most storage per dollar, the hard drive is also a more economical device than other options.</p>

					<p class="start moreSpacing">Today, most desktop system units are designed to support more than one internal hard drive. The Apple Mac Pro has room for four hard drives, and the Thermaltake Level 10 can support six hard drives. Each one simply slides into place when you want to add more storage.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How is data stored on a hard drive?</strong> A hard drive is composed of several coated, round, thin plates of metal stacked on a spindle. Each plate is called a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>platter</span>. When data is saved to a hard drive platter, a pattern of magnetized spots is created on the iron oxide coating of each platter. When the spots are aligned in one direction, they represent a <em>1</em>; when they’re aligned in the other direction, they represent a <em>0</em>. These <em>0s</em> and <em>1s</em> are <em>bits</em> ( or <em>binary digits</em>) and are the smallest pieces of data that computers can understand. When data stored on the hard drive platter is retrieved (or read), your computer translates these patterns of magnetized spots into the data you have saved.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>How quickly does a hard drive find information?</strong> The hard drive’s <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>access time</span>, the time it takes a storage device to locate its stored data and make it available for processing, is faster than optical drives. Mechanical hard drive access times are measured in milliseconds (ms), meaning thousandths of seconds. For large-capacity drives, access times of approximately 12 to 13 milliseconds are typical. That’s less than one-hundredth of a second. For comparison, a DVD drive can take over 150 milliseconds to access data.</p>

Having no mechanical motors allows SSDs to offer incredibly fast access times, reaching data in only a tenth of a millisecond (0.1 ms). That’s about 100 times faster than mechanical hard drives (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(16,0)">see Figure 6.14</span>)! SSDs also have a great advantage when booting up since a mechanical hard drive has to wait for motors to bring the plates up to the final rotation speed.

					<p class="start"><strong>Why can I store data on some optical discs but not others?</strong> All forms of optical media come in three formats:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Prerecorded</em> discs are read-only (ROM), meaning you can’t save any data onto them.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Recordable</em> (R) formats allow you to write data to them, but only once.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><em>Rewriteable</em> (RW) discs let you write and rewrite data to them many times.</span></li>
					</ol>
					
					<p class="start"><strong>Should I bother having an optical disc drive?</strong> Traditionally, optical media delivered music and movies, but these are now available through streaming services. Likewise, in the past, software was often installed from a DVD, but now you buy almost all software online. Therefore, many lightweight systems have stopped including optical drives. For example, netbooks and ultrabooks are so thin and lightweight they often leave out an optical drive but may include a slot for an SD memory card to allow you to transfer files. You can buy external optical drives, but if you have a need for optical drives, you’re probably better off purchasing a laptop computer; these have optical drives.</p>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Your Storage Capacity and Needs</h2>
					<p><strong>How do I know how much storage capacity I have?</strong> Typically, hard drive capacity is measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (1 TB = 1,000GB). Windows displays the hard drives, their capacity, and usage information, as shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(18,0)">Figure 6.17</span>. To get a slightly more detailed view, select a drive and then right-click and choose Properties.</p>

If you plan to have a system backup on the same drive, be sure to budget for that room as well. However, note that if you’re going to store your data files online instead of on your computer, you may not need much hard drive space. For example, if you stream all the movies you watch from Netflix, keep all your data files in Microsoft SkyDrive, and use online software like Google Docs to edit, you may need very little hard drive space. Most ultrabooks like the Dell XPS 13 or the Apple MacBook Air are configured with 128-GB drives. In fact, many Chromebooks have only a 16-GB drive.</p>

					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Is it better to have one huge drive or several smaller drives?</strong> It depends on what’s important to you: speed or security. If you purchase two smaller drives, you can combine them using RAID technology. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="redundant array of independent disks (raid)">RAID (redundant array of independent disks)</span> is a set of strategies for using more than one drive in a system (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(19,0)">see Figure 6.19</span>).

If disk performance is very important—for example, when you’re doing video editing or sound recording—using two files in RAID 0 could be important. RAID 0 is faster because every time data is written to a hard drive, it’s spread across the two physical drives (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(19,0)">see Figure 6.19a</span>). The write begins on the first drive, and while the system is waiting for that write to be completed, the system jumps ahead and begins to write the next block of data to the second drive. This makes writing information to disk almost twice as fast as using just one hard drive. The downside is that if either of these disks fail, you lose all your data because part of each file is on each drive. So RAID 0 is for those most concerned with performance.</span></li>

Designers can change the type of light, the texture, and the color of objects based on complex interactions. Some GPU designs incorporate dedicated hardware to allow high-definition movies to be decoded or special physics engines to model water, gravity, and rigid body movements.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>Why do some people use more than one video card in the same system?</strong> For users who are primarily doing text-based work, one  video card is certainly enough. Computer gamers and users of high-end visualization software, however, often take advantage of the ability to install more than one video card at a time. Two or even three video cards can be used in one system.</p>
					<p class="start">The two major video chip set manufacturers, Nvidia and ATI, have each developed their own standards supporting the combining of multiple video cards. For Nvidia, this standard is named SLI; for ATI, it is called CrossFire. When the system is running at very high video resolutions, such as 1920 x 1200 or higher, multiple video cards working together provide the ultimate in performance. If you’re buying a new system and might be interested in employing multiple video cards, be sure to check whether the motherboard supports SLI or CrossFire.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>Can I run a few monitors from one video card?</strong> Working with multiple monitors is useful if you often have more than one application running  at a time (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(25,0)">Figure 6.24</span>) or even if you just want to expand your gaming experience.

					<p class="start"><strong>How do I know if I’m putting too much demand on my video card?</strong> If your monitor takes a while to refresh when you’re editing photos or playing a graphics-rich game, then the video card could be short on memory or the GPU is being taxed beyond its capacity. You can evaluate this precisely using the software that came with your card. For example, AMD Overdrive software monitors the GPU usage level, the current temperature, and the fan speed.</p>
					<p class="start">Review the considerations listed in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(26,2)">Figure 6.25</span> to see if it might be time for you to upgrade your video card. On a desktop computer, replacing a video card is fairly simple: Just insert the new video card in the correct expansion slot on the motherboard. The video card in a laptop is more difficult to upgrade since the display and keyboard usually have to be removed to replace the video card. Note that some very basic laptop systems have video adapters integrated into the motherboard, so these video cards can’t be upgraded.</p>

					<p class="moreSpacing">For many users, a computer’s preinstalled speakers and sound card are adequate. However, if you often use your computer to play games, music, and video, you may want to upgrade your speakers or your sound card.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>What does the sound card do?</strong> Like a video card, a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>sound card</span> is an expansion card that attaches to the motherboard inside your system unit. A sound card enables the computer to drive the speaker system. Most desktop systems have a separate sound card, although low-end computers often have integrated the job of managing sound onto the motherboard itself. You can upgrade laptop sound cards using an ExpressCard solution, like the Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>What does a basic sound card do for me?</strong> Many computers ship with a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>3-D sound card</span>. 3-D sound technology is better at convincing the human ear that sound is omnidirectional, meaning that you can’t tell from which direction the sound is coming. This tends to produce a fuller, richer sound than stereo sound. However, 3-D sound is not surround sound.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>What is surround sound, then?</strong> <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Surround sound</span> is a type of audio processing that makes the listener experience sound as if it were coming from all directions by using multiple speakers. The current</p>

					<p class="moreSpacing">surround sound standard is from Dolby. There are many formats available, including Dolby Digital EX and Dolby Digital Plus for high-definition audio. Dolby TrueHD is the newest standard. It features highdefinition and lossless technology, which means that no information is lost in the compression process.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">To create surround sound, another standard, Dolby Digital 7.1, takes digital sound from a medium (such as a Blu-ray disc) and reproduces it in eight channels. Seven channels cover the listening field with placement to the left front, right front, left rear, right rear, and center of the audio stage, as well as two extra speakers to the side, as shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(28,0)">Figure 6.28</span>. The eighth channel holds extremely low-frequency sound data and is sent to a subwoofer, which can be placed anywhere in the room.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing">The name 7.1 surround indicates that there are seven speakers reproducing the full audio spectrum and one speaker handling just lower frequency bass sounds. There is also a 5.1 surround sound standard, which has a total of six speakers—one subwoofer, a center speaker, and four speakers for right/left in the front and the back. If you have a larger space or want precise location of sounds, use the newer 7.1 system.</p>

					<p class="start"><strong>Does it matter what kind of speakers my laptop has?</strong> The limited size for speakers in a laptop and the added weight of circuitry to drive them means most people use headphones or ear buds for great audio instead of speakers. However, some laptops have built-in higher-quality speakers, like the Alienware line featuring Klipsch speakers and the HP series offering Beats speakers.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>What setup do I need if I want to use my computer for recording my band?</strong> You can connect MIDI instruments, high-quality microphones, and recording equipment to your computer through an <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>audio MIDI interface</span> box. MIDI is an electronics standard that allows different kinds of electronic instruments to communicate with each other and with computers. The audio interface box attaches to your computer through a USB port and adds jacks for connecting guitars and microphones.

					<p> Many computer users decide to buy a new system because they’re experiencing problems such as slow performance, freezes, and crashes. Over time, even normal use can cause your computer to build up excess files and to become internally disorganized. This excess, clutter, and disorganization can lead to deteriorating performance or system failure. If you think your system is unreliable, see if the problem is one you can fix before you buy a new machine. Proper upkeep and maintenance also may postpone an expensive system upgrade or replacement.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>What can I do to ensure my system stays reliable?</strong> Here are several procedures you can follow to ensure your system performs reliably (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(30,0)">see also Figure 6.31</span>):</p>
					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi"><strong>Clear out unnecessary files.</strong> Temporary Internet files can accumulate quickly on your hard drive, taking up unnecessary space. Running the Disk Cleanup utility is a quick and easy way to ensure your temporary Internet files don’t take up precious hard drive space. Likewise, you should delete any unnecessary files from your hard drive regularly because they can make your hard drive run more slowly.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi"><strong>Install a reliable antivirus package.</strong> Make sure it’s set to update itself automatically and to run a full system scan frequently.</span></li>

						<li class="lessSpacing"><span class="innerLi"><strong>Run the Disk Defragmenter utility on your hard drive.</strong> When your hard drive becomes fragmented, its storage capacity is negatively affected. When you defragment (defrag) your hard drive, files are reorganized, making the hard drive work more efficiently. But remember that this only makes sense for mechanical drives. With no motors, there is no need to defrag an SSD drive.</span></li>

						<li><span class="innerLi">If a Refresh wasn’t enough to fix the problem, consider a full system restore.</span><span class="innerLi notStrong"> Windows 8 automatically creates restore points before any major change to the system takes place, such as when you install a new program or change a device driver. By default, Windows also makes a restore point every 7 days. (You can also manually create a restore point at any time.) You can then select any restore point and bring your system back to the state it was in at that point.

					<p>Now that you’ve evaluated your computer system, you need to shift to questions of value. How closely does your system come to meeting your needs? How much would it cost to upgrade your current system to match what you’d ideally like your computer to do, not only today but also a few years from now? How much would it cost to purchase a new system that meets these specifications?</p>
					<p class="start">To know whether upgrading or buying a new system would have better value for you, you need to price both scenarios. Conduct a thorough system evaluation (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(33,0)">Figure 6.33</span>) to gather the data to help you decide. Purchasing a new system is an important investment of your resources, and you want to make a well-reasoned, well-supported decision.</p>

					<p><strong>What should I do with my old computer?</strong> Before you get rid of your computer, be sure to consider what benefit you might obtain by having two systems. Would you have a use for the older system? Would you be able to donate it?</p>
					<p class="start">Also, before you decide to throw it away, consider the environmental impact (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(33,1)">Figure 6.34</span>).

					<p>alarming, emerging trend is that discarded machines are beginning to create an e-waste crisis.</p>

Firms like GigaBiter (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://gigabiter.com','_blank')">gigabiter.com</span>) offer a solution. GigaBiter eliminates security and environmental risks associated with electronic destruction by first delaminating the hard drive and then breaking down the computer e-waste into recyclable products. The result of the final step is a sand-like substance that is 100% recyclable.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>Can I donate a computer safely, without worrying about my personal data?</strong> Before donating or recycling a computer, make sure you carefully remove all data from your hard drive. Built into Windows 8 is a tool to help with this, Windows 8 Reset. It removes all user-installed  applications and all of your personal data, and resets your PC settings back to the default values.</p> 
					<p class="start">Becoming a victim of identity theft is a serious risk. Credit card numbers, bank information, Social Security numbers, tax records, passwords, and personal identification numbers (PINs) are just some of the types of sensitive information that we casually record to our computers’ hard drives. Just deleting files that contain proprietary personal information is not protection enough. Likewise, reformatting or erasing your hard drive does not totally remove data, as was proved by two MIT graduate students. They</p>

					<p class="start">The U.S. Department of Defense suggests a seven-layer overwrite for a “secure erase.” This means that you fill your hard drive seven times over with a random series of 1s and 0s. Fortunately, several programs exist for doing this. For PCs running Windows, look for utility programs like File Shredder or Eraser. Wipe is available for Linux, and ShredIt X can be used for Mac OS X. These programs provide secure hard drive erasures, either of specific files on your hard drive or of the entire hard drive. </p>

			<h3>Many Different Computers for Many Different Needs</h3>
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p class="moreSpacing">Even within one discipline, there are needs for a variety of types of computing solutions. Consider the Communications department in a large university. Because it’s an interdisciplinary area, there are some groups involved in video production, some groups producing digital music, and some groups creating scripts and screenplays. The department as a whole needs to decide on a complete computing strategy.</p>
			
			<h4>Process</h4>

			<ol>
				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Split the class into teams.</span></li>
				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Select one segment of the Communications department that your team will represent: video production, digital music, or scripting. The video production team requires its labs to be able to support the recording, editing, and final production and distribution of digital video. The digital music group wants to establish a collegiate recording studio (after the model of the Drexel University recording label, Mad Dragon Records). The scripting group needs to support a collaborative community of writers and voice-over actors.</span></li>
				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Analyze the computing needs of that segment, with particular focus on how it needs to outfit its computer labs.</span></li>

				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Write a report that summarizes your findings. Document the resources you used and generate as much enthusiasm as you can for your recommendations.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p class="moreSpacing">The range of available computing solutions has never been so broad. It can be a cause of confusion for those not educated in technology. But with a firm understanding of the basic subsystems of computers, it is precisely this pace of change that is exciting. Being able to evaluate a computer system and match it to the current needs of its users is an important skill.</p>

			<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
			<p class="moreSpacing">In this exercise, you’ll research and then role-play a complicated ethical situation. The role you play might not match your own personal beliefs; regardless, your research and use of logic will enable you to represent the view assigned. An arbitrator will watch and comment on both sides of the arguments, and together, the team will agree on an ethical solution.</p>
			
		<br/>	
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p class="moreSpacing">We’ve seen that for complex systems like computers, performance often is determined not by comparing the specifications of individual parts but by using benchmarks, software suites that test a full area of performance. There are benchmarks for battery life, for CPU performance, and for video performance. The results of these tests become a major force in marketing and selling the product.</p>
			<p class="start moreSpacing">There have been a number of claims of unethical conduct in the area of benchmarking. Companies have been accused of using out-of-date testing software to skew their results. Some companies have manipulated the settings on the machine to artificially raise their score (for example, turning off the display and wireless network before testing for battery life). Some companies have a pattern of making sure	the systems sent out to magazines and other evaluators have</p>

				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Research the areas cited above from the perspective of either an Intel engineer working on a new CPU, an AMD engineer working on a competing CPU, or a benchmark designer.</span></li>
				<li class="moreSpacing"><span class="notStrong">Team members should write a summary that provides factual documentation for the positions and views their character takes around the issue of equitable testing of hardware. Then, team members should create an outline to use during the role-playing event.</span></li>
