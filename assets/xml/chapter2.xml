Computer manufacturers, such as Sony, Asus, and Toshiba, are producing <strong>high-end laptops</strong> that have 3-D viewing capabilities. That means <strong>games, photos, movies, and websites</strong> can be experienced in 3-D. These machines are targeted toward <strong>gamers and 3-D movie enthusiasts</strong> and require high-end graphics components, such as the 3-D kit by NVIDIA that includes a combination of a sophisticated graphics processor unit and monitor, software, and <strong>specialized 3-D glasses</strong>, to achieve the 3-D effects. The first no-glasses 3-D laptop was introduced by Toshiba in late 2011. It uses the laptop’s web camera and eye-tracking technology to create the 3-D effects. Although this laptop’s <strong>high price and weight</strong> (9 lbs.) are not attractive to some users, 3-D in an affordable, portable format that doesn’t require glasses is definitely on the horizon.</p>

					<div class="HeadingGreenBackDiagDashes">Understanding Digital Components</div>
					<p class="digCompP">After reading Chapter 1, you can see why becoming computer literate is important. But where do you start? You’ve no doubt gleaned some knowledge about computers just from being a member of society. However, even if you have used a computer before, do you really understand how it works, what all its parts are, and what those parts do?</p>
					<div class="greenHeadingLineDashed"></div>

					<div class="fancyHeadingOB">
						<div class="orange">understanding your</div>
						<div class="blue">computer</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>Let’s start our look at <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="computer">computers</span> by discussing what a computer does and how its functions make it such a useful machine.</p>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Computers Are Data Processing Devices</h2>
					<p>Strictly defined, a computer  is a data processing device that performs four major functions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Input:</strong> It gathers data, or allows users to enter data.
						<li><strong>Process:</strong> It manipulates, calculates, or organizes that data into
						    information.
						<li><strong>Output:</strong> It displays data and information in a form suitable for the
						    user.
						<li><strong>Storage:</strong> It saves data and information for later use.
					</ol>
					<p class="start"><strong>What is the difference between data and information?</strong> People often use the terms <em>data</em> and <em>information</em> interchangeably. Although they may mean the same thing in a simple conversation, the distinction between data and information is an important one.
					</p>
				]]>
			</section>
			<section>
				<![CDATA[
					<p class="start">In computer terms. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>data</span> is a representaion of a fact, a figure, or an idea. Date can be a number, a word, a picture, or even a recording of sound. For example, the number 7135553297 and the names Zoe and Richardson are pieces of data. Alone, these pieces of data probably mean little to you. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Information</span> is data that has been organized or presented in a meaningful fashion. When your computer provides you with a contact listing that indicates Zoe Richardson can be reached at (713) 555-3297, the data becomes useful—that is, it becomes information.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>How do computers interact with data and information?</strong> Computers are excellent at <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>processing</span> (manipulating, calculating, or organizing) data into information. When you first arrived on campus, you probably were directed to a place where you could get an ID card. You most likely provided a clerk with personal data that was entered into a computer. The clerk then took your picture with a digital camera (collecting more data). All of the data was then processed appropriately so that it could be printed on your ID card (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(4,0)">see Figure 2.1</span>). This organized output of data on your ID card is useful information.</p><br>

					<h2 class="blueHeading">Bits and Bytes:<br>
					The Language of Computers</h2>
					<p><strong>How do computers process data into information?</strong> Unlike humans, computers work exclusively with numbers (not words). To process data into  information, computers need to work in a language they
					understand. This language, called <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>binary language</span>, consists of just two digits: 0 and 1. </p>

Each 0 and 1 is a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="binary digit (bit)">binary digit</span>, or <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="binary digit (bit)">bit</span> for short.

					<p class="moreSpacing">special character (such as @, pronounced “at”) consists of a unique combination of eight bits, or
					a string of eight 0s and 1s. So, for example, in binary language, the letter <em>K</em> is represented as 01001011. This is eight bits, or one byte.</p>
						
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>What else can bits and bytes be used for?</strong> Bits and bytes not only are used as the language that tells the computer what to do, they are also used to represent the <em>quantity</em> of data and information that the computer inputs and outputs. Word processing files, digital pictures, and even software are represented inside a computer as a series of bits and bytes. These files and applications can be quite large, containing thousands or millions of bytes.</p>

				<![CDATA[

					<p class="start">To make it easier to measure the size of such files, we need units of measure larger than a byte. Kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes are therefore simply larger amounts of bytes. As shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(5,0)">Figure 2.2</span>, a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>kilobyte (KB)</span> is approximately 1,000 bytes, a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>megabyte (MB)</span> is about 1 million bytes, and a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>gigabyte (GB)</span> is around 1 billion bytes. Today, personal computers are capable of storing <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="terabyte (TB)">terabytes (TB)</span> of data (around 1 trillion bytes), and many business computers can store up to a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>petabyte (PB)</span> (1,000 terabytes) of data. The Google search engine processes more than 1 PB of user-generated data per <em>hour!</em></p>
					<p class="start"><strong>How does your computer process bits and bytes?</strong> Your computer uses hardware and software to process data into information that lets you complete tasks such as writing a letter or playing a game. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Hardware</span> is any part of the computer you can physically touch. However, a computer needs more than just hardware to work. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Software</span> is the set of computer programs that enables the hardware to perform different tasks.</p>

					<p class="start">There are two broad categories of software: <em>application software and system software.</em> <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Application software</span> is the set of programs you use on a computer to help you carry out tasks such as writing a research paper. If you’ve ever typed a document, created a spreadsheet, or edited a digital photo, for example, you’ve used application software.</p>

					<p class="start"><span class="strongDBlue" glossary>System software</span> is the set of programs that enables your computer’s hardware devices and application software to work together.

					<h2 class="blueHeading">Types of Computers</h2>
					<p><strong>What types of computers are popular for personal use?</strong> There are two basic designs of computers: portable and stationary. For portable computers, a number of options exist:</p>

					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi">A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>laptop (or notebook) computer</span> is a portable computer that has a keyboard, monitor, and other devices integrated into a single compact case.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>netbook</span> is a small, lightweight laptop computer that is generally 7 to 10 inches wide and has a longer battery life than a laptop.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>tablet PC</span> is similar to a laptop computer, but the monitor swivels</span></li>

				  commands primarily by using a special pen called a <em>stylus</em> across the
				  touch screen, and you can input text by pressing keys on the virtual
				  keyboard.</span></li>
				<li><span class="innerLi">In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, which created a new class of
				  portable computers. A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>tablet computer</span>, such as the iPad or Samsung
				  Galaxy Tab, is a portable computer integrated into a flat
				  multitouchsensitive screen. It uses an onscreen virtual keyboard,
				  but you can connect separate keyboards to it via Bluetooth or wires.</span></li>
				<li><span class="innerLi">An <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>ultrabook</span> is a full-featured but lightweight laptop computer
				  designed to compete with the MacBook Air. Ultrabooks feature low-power processors and solid state drives and try to reduce their size and weight to extend battery life without sacrificing performance.</span>
				</li>
				</ul>
					<p class="start">A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>desktop computer</span> is intended for use at a single location, so it is stationary. Most desktop computers consist of a separate case or tower (called the <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>system unit</span>) that houses the main components of the computer plus peripheral devices. A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>peripheral device</span> is a component, such as a monitor or keyboard, that connects to the computer. An <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>all-in-one computer</span>, such as the Apple iMac (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(7,0)">Figure 2.3b</span>) or HP TouchSmart, eliminates the need for a separate tower because these computers house the computer’s processor and memory in the monitor. Many all-in-one models, such as the TouchSmart, also incorporate touch-screen technology.</p>

				<p class="start"><strong>What’s special about laptop keyboards?</strong> To save space and weight, netbook and smaller laptop keyboards (14 inches and under) are more compact than standard desktop keyboards and, therefore, often have fewer keys. To retain the same functionality as a standard keyboard, some laptop keys may have alternative functions.</p>
				<p class="start"><strong>How do wireless keyboards work?</strong> Wireless keyboards are powered by batteries, so you’re not tied to the computer by wires. These keyboards send data to the computer using a form of wireless technology that uses <em>radio frequency</em> (RF). A radio transmitter in the keyboard sends out signals that are received either by a receiving device plugged into a USB port or by a Bluetooth receiving device located in the system unit. You’ve probably heard of <span class="strongDBlue" glossary="bluetooth (technology)">Bluetooth technology</span> if you use a headset or earpiece with your cell phone. Bluetooth is a wireless transmission standard that lets you connect devices such as cell phones, smartphones, and computers to peripheral devices such as keyboards and headsets. If you use a wireless keyboard with your home computer, you can be as far as 6 to 30 feet from your computer, depending on the quality of the keyboard. Wireless keyboards used in conference rooms or auditoriums can be as far away as 100 feet from the computer.</p>

				<p><strong>What kinds of mice are there?</strong> The mouse type you’re probably most familiar with is the <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>optical mouse</span>. An optical mouse uses an internal sensor or laser to detect the mouse’s movement. The sensor sends signals to the computer, telling it where to move the pointer on the screen. Optical mice don’t require a mouse pad, though you can use one to enhance the movement of the mouse on an uneven surface or to protect your work surface from being scratched.</p>

					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>What factors affect the quality of an LCD monitor?</strong> When choosing an LCD monitor, the most important factors to consider are aspect ratio and resolution. The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>aspect ratio</span> is the width-to-height proportion of a monitor. Traditionally, aspect ratios have been 4:3, but newer monitors are available with an aspect ratio of 16:9 to accommodate HD format video. The screen <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>resolution</span>, or the clearness or sharpness of the image, reflects the number of pixels on the screen. An LCD monitor may have a native (or maximum) resolution of 1600 × 1200, meaning it contains 1,600 vertical columns with 1,200 pixels in each column. The higher the resolution, the sharper and clearer the image will be, but generally, the resolution of an LCD monitor is dictated by the screen size and aspect ratio. Although you can change the resolution of an LCD monitor beyond its native resolution, the images will become distorted. Generally, you should buy a monitor with the highest resolution available for the screen size (measured in inches). <span onclick="compTia.togglePopup(15,0)" class="strongDBlue" >Figure 2.20</span> lists these and other factors to consider when judging the quality of an LCD monitor.</p>

In fact, when loaded with the right paper, higher-end inkjet printers can print images that look like professional-quality photos. One thing to consider when buying an inkjet printer is the type and cost of the ink cartridges the printer needs. Some printers use two cartridges: black and color.

					<strong>What are the output devices for sound?</strong> Most computers include inexpensive <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>speakers</span>, which are the output devices for sound. These speakers are sufficient to play the standard audio clips you find on the web and usually for letting you participate in videoconferencing or phone calls over the Internet. However, if you plan to digitally edit audio files or are particular about how your music sounds, you may want a more sophisticated speaker system, such as one that includes subwoofers (special speakers that produce only low bass sounds) and surround-sound speakers.</p>

					<p> A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>surround-sound speaker</span> is a system of speakers and audio processing that envelops the listener in a 360-degree field of sound. In addition, wireless speaker systems are available to help you avoid cluttering up your rooms with speaker wires.</p>

					<p class="start lessSpacing">If you work in close proximity to other employees or travel with a laptop, you may need to use headphones or earbuds to avoid distracting other people. Both devices plug into the same jack on the computer to which speakers connect. Studies of users of portable media players have shown that hearing might be damaged by excessive volume, especially when using earbuds because they fit into the ear canals.

A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>network interface card (NIC)</span>, which enables your computer to connect with other computers or to a cable modem to facilitate a high-speed Internet connection, is now the most common connectivity port.

RAM is much faster to read from and write to than the hard drive and other forms of storage. The processor can request the RAM’s contents, which can be located, opened, and delivered to the CPU for processing in a few nanoseconds (billionths of a second). If you look at a motherboard, you’ll see RAM as a series of small cards (called <em>memory cards</em> or <em>memory modules</em>) plugged into slots on the motherboard (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.switchPage(0,22)">see Figure 2.26</span>).</p>

					<p class="start"><strong>Does the motherboard contain any other kinds of memory besides RAM?</strong> In addition to RAM, the motherboard contains a form of memory called <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>read-only memory (ROM)</span>. ROM holds all the instructions the computer needs to start up when it is powered on. Unlike data stored in RAM, which is volatile storage, the instructions stored in ROM are permanent, making ROM a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>nonvolatile storage</span> location, which means the data isn’t erased when the power is turned off.</p><br/>
					
					<h2 class="blueHeading">Processing</h2>
					<p><strong>What is the CPU?</strong> The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>central processing unit (CPU, or processor)</span>  is sometimes referred to as the “brains” of the computer because it controls all the functions performed by the computer’s other components and processes all the commands issued to it by software instructions. Modern CPUs can perform as many as tens of billions of tasks per second without error, making them extremely powerful components.</p>

					<p class="start"><strong>How is processor speed measured?</strong> Processor speed is measured in units of hertz (Hz). Hertz is a measurement of machine cycles per second. A machine cycle is the process of the CPU getting the data or instructions from RAM and decoding the instructions into something the computer can understand. Once the CPU has decoded the instructions, it executes them and stores the result back in system memory. Current systems run at speeds measured in <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>gigahertz (GHz)</span>, or billions of machine cycles per second. Therefore, a 3.8 GHz processor performs work at a rate of 3.8 billion</p>

					<p>machine cycles per second. It’s important to realize, however, that CPU processor speed alone doesn’t determine the performance of the CPU.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>What else determines processor performance?</strong> Although speed is an important consideration when determining processor performance, CPU performance is also affected by other factors. One factor is the number of cores, or processing paths, a processor has. Initially, processors could handle only one instruction at a time. Now, processors have been designed so that they can have two, four, or even eight different paths, allowing them to process more than one instruction at a time (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(23,0)">see Figure 2.27</span>). Applications such as virus protection software and the operating system, which are always running behind the scenes, can have their own processor paths, freeing up the other paths to run other applications such as a web browser, Word, or iTunes more efficiently.</p>
					<p class="start"><strong>Besides the number of cores, what other factors determine processing power?</strong> The “best” processor will depend on your particular needs and is not always the processor with the highest processor speed and the greatest number of cores. Intel, one of the leading manufacturers of computer processor chips, has created a pictorial rating system for CPU chips. Intel uses one to five stars to illustrate the relative computing power of each type of CPU within the Intel line of processors.</p>

USB ports can connect a wide variety of peripherals, including keyboards, printers, mice, smartphones, external hard drives, flash drives, and digital cameras, to the computer. USB 2.0 ports are the current standard and transfer data at 480 megabits per second (Mbps). The new USB 3.0 standard provides transfer speeds of 4.8 Gbps and charges devices faster than its predecessor. USB 3.0 is quickly becoming the port of choice.</p>

The FireWire 400 interface moves data at 400 Mbps, whereas the FireWire 800 doubles the rate to 800 Mbps. Devices such as external hard drives, digital video cameras, portable music players, and digital media players all benefit from the speedy data transfer capabilities of FireWire. FireWire 400 ports have two different configurations, as shown in <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(28,0)">Figure 2.34</span>. FireWire 400 ports on computers generally have six pins, whereas FireWire 400 ports on digital cameras have four pins.</p>

				<p class="start" "lessSpacing">To transfer data between two devices, a special cable that has an appropriate connector at each end is needed. The faster FireWire 800 requires a nine-pin connection and is found on storage devices such as external and portable hard drives. The FireWire 3200 standard, with data transfer rates of 3.2 Gbps, has been ratified but has yet to reach the market.</p>
				
				<h2 class="blueHeading">Connectivity and Multimedia Ports</h2>
				<p class="lessSpacing"><strong>Which ports help me connect with other computers and the Internet?</strong> Another set of ports on your computer helps you communicate with other computers. A <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>connectivity port</span> can give you access to networks and the Internet. To find a connectivity port, look for a port that resembles a standard phone jack but is slightly larger. This port is called an <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Ethernet port</span> (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(28,0)">see Figure 2.34</span>). Ethernet ports transfer data at speeds up to 10,000 Mbps. You can use an Ethernet port to connect your computer to a digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem, or to a network. Some computers still feature a second connectivity port that will accept a standard phone line connector. This jack is the <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>modem port</span> (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(28,0)">see Figure 2.34</span>). It uses a traditional telephone signal to connect the computer to the Internet over a phone line. Modem ports are quickly becoming legacy technology.</p>

				<p>The latest digital connector designed for use in HD home theater environments is a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI)</span>, a compact audio–video interface that carries both HD video and uncompressed digital audio on one cable. (DVI can only carry video signals.) Because HDMI can transmit uncompressed audio and video, there’s no need to convert the signal, which could ultimately reduce the quality of the sound or picture. Most DVD players, televisions, and game consoles have at least one HDMI port (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(29,2)">see Figure 2.37</span>).</p>

				<p class="moreSpacing"><strong>What if I don’t have all the ports I need?</strong> If you’re looking to add the newest ports to an older desktop computer or to expand the number of ports on it, you can install special expansion cards into an open expansion slot on the motherboard to provide additional ports. If your laptop computer requires additional ports, you can add them with an express card adapter, which fits into a slot on the side of your laptop. <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(30,0)">Figure 2.38</span> shows an example of both of these scenarios.</p>
				<p class="start moreSpacing">Another alternative is adding an expansion hub (<span class="strongDBlue" onclick="compTia.togglePopup(30,1)">shown in Figure 2.39</span>).

					<p class="moreSpacing"><strong>What’s the best way to turn my computer on and off?</strong> The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>power supply</span>, which is housed inside the system unit, transforms the wall voltage to the voltages required by computer chips. Powering on your computer from a completely turned off state, such as when you start your computer in the morning, is called a <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>cold boot</span>. In Windows 8, you can turn your computer off by pressing the computer’s power button or by using the Shut Down option from the power icon found under Settings on the Charms bar.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Should I turn off my computer every time I’m done using it?</strong>
					Some people say you should leave your computer on at all times. They argue that turning your computer on and off throughout the day subjects its components to stress because the heating and cooling process forces the components to expand and contract repeatedly. Other people say you should shut down your computer when you’re not using it. They claim that it’s not as environmentally friendly and that you’ll end up wasting money on electricity from the computer running all the time.</p>

				<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Can I “rest” my computer without turning it off completely?</strong>  In Windows 8, the main method of power management is Sleep. When your computer enters <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Sleep mode</span>, all of the documents, applications, and data you were using remain in RAM (memory), where they’re quickly accessible when you restart your computer.</p>

				<a onclick="compTia.togglePopup(31,0)" class="readMore"></a>

				<p class="start moreSpacing">The <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Hibernate</span> option is similar to Sleep except that your data is stored on your hard drive instead of in RAM and your computer is powered off. This uses much less battery power than Sleep and is a good choice if you won’t be using your laptop for a  long time and won’t have the opportunity to charge it. However, Sleep is still a good option to choose if you just won’t be using your computer for a short time. You may want to set your computer so it sleeps when you close the lid but hibernates when you press the power button, giving you quick access to either option.</p>

					<p class="moreSpacing">It’s important that you understand not only your computer’s components and how they work together but also how to set up these components safely. <span class="strongDBlue" glossary>Ergonomics</span> is the science that deals with the design and location of machines and furniture so that the people using them aren’t subjected to an uncomfortable or unsafe experience. In terms of computing, ergonomics refers to how you set up your computer and other equipment to minimize your risk of injury or discomfort.</p>
					<p class="start moreSpacing"><strong>Why is ergonomics important?</strong> Studies suggest that teenagers, on average, spend 31 hours online each week. When you factor in other computer uses such as typing school reports and playing video games, there is great potential for injury. The repetitive nature of long-term computer activities can place too much stress on joints and pull at the tendons and muscles, causing repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. These injuries can take months or years to develop to a point where they become painful, and by the time you notice the symptoms, the damage has already taken place. If you take precautionary measures now, you may prevent years of unnecessary pain later.</p>

						<li><span class="innerLi">Output devices enable you to send processed data out of your computer. It can take the form of text, pictures, sounds, or video.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Monitors display soft copies of text, graphics, and video, whereas printers create hard copies of text and graphics.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">There are two primary categories of printers: inkjet and laser. Specialty printers are also available. These include all-in-one printers, plotters, and thermal printers. When choosing a printer, you should be aware of factors such as speed, resolution, color output, and cost.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Speakers are the output devices for sound. Most computers include speakers; more-sophisticated systems include subwoofers and surround sound.</span></li>

					<h2 style="margin:0 0 4px">Processing, Memory, and Storage</h2>
					<span class="prePseudoLi preContent6 strong">What’s on the motherboard?</span>

					<ul class="dotted clearLeft TMargin25">
						<li><span class="innerLi">The motherboard, the main circuit board of the system, contains a computer’s CPU, which coordinates  the functions of all other devices on the computer. The performance of a CPU is affected by the speed of the processor (measured in GHz), the amount of cache memory, and the number of processing cores.</span></li>

					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi">RAM, the computer’s volatile memory, is also located on the motherboard. RAM is where all the data and instructions are held while the computer is running.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">ROM, a permanent type of memory, is responsible for housing instructions to help start up a computer.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">The motherboard also houses slots for expansion cards, which have specific functions that augment the computer’s basic functions. Typical expansion cards are sound and video cards.</span></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>7. Where are information and programs stored?</h4>
					<ul class="dotted">
						<li><span class="innerLi">To save programs and information permanently, you need to save them to the hard drive or to another permanent storage device such as a CD, DVD, or flash drive.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">The hard drive is your computer’s primary device for permanent storage of software and files. The hard drive is a nonvolatile storage device, meaning it holds the data and instructions your computer needs permanently, even after the computer is turned off.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Mechanical hard drives have spinning platters on which data is saved, whereas newer solid-state drives (SSDs) use solid-state memory, similar to that used with flash drives.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">External hard drives are essentially internal hard drives that have been made portable by enclosing them in a protective case and making them small and lightweight.</span></li>

						<li><span class="innerLi">Optical drives that can read from and write to CD, DVD, or Blu-ray discs are another means of permanent, portable storage. Data is saved to CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs as pits that are burned into the disc by a laser.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Flash drives are another portable means of storing data. Flash drives plug into USB ports.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Flash memory cards let you transfer digital data between your computer and devices such as digital cameras, smartphones, video cameras, and printers.</span></li>

					<span class="prePseudoLi preContent8 strong">How are devices connected to the computer?</span>

					<ul class="dotted clearLeft TMargin25">
						<li><span class="innerLi">There is a wide variety of ports that allow you to hook up peripheral devices (such as your monitor and keyboard) to your system.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">The most common type of port used to connect devices to a computer is the USB port. USB 2.0 is the current standard but is quickly being replaced by the newer, faster USB 3.0 standard.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">FireWire ports provide additional options for data transfer.</span></li>
						<li><span class="innerLi">Connectivity ports, including Ethernet ports and modem ports, give you access to networks and the Internet and enable your computer to function as a fax machine.</span></li>

					<li><span class="innerLi">Multimedia ports include VGA and DVI ports. They connect the computer to monitors and other multimedia devices.</span></li>
					<li><span class="innerLi">Audio ports are where you connect headphones, microphones, and speakers to the computer.</span></li>
					<li><span class="innerLi">HDMI ports are used as a connection between monitors, TVs, and gaming consoles and work with both audio and video content.</span></li>
				</ul>

					<h4>9. What’s the best way to turn my computer on and off, and when should it be done?</h4>
				<ul class="dotted">
					<li><span class="innerLi">Powering on your computer from a completely turned off state. In Windows 8, you can turn your computer off by pressing the computer’s power button or by using the Shut Down option from the power icon found under Settings on the Charms bar.</span></li>
					<li><span class="innerLi">With the power-management options of Windows 8, for example, you only need to shut down your computer completely when you need to repair or install hardware in the system unit or move it to another location. However, if you use your computer only for a little while each day, it would be best to power it off completely after each daily use.</span></li>

			<h3>Which Mobile Device Is the Best?</h3>
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p>You’ve joined a small business that’s beginning to evaluate its technology setup. Because of the addition of several new sales representatives and other administrative employees, many new computers need to be purchased. You’re trying to decide which mobile devices would be better to purchase—laptop computers, tablet PCs, tablet computers (iPads), or a combination of these devices.</p>
			<h4>Task</h4>
			Split your class into teams of three and assign the following tasks.

			<span class="psudoUlLi">Member A explores the benefits and downfalls of laptop computers.</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Member B explores the benefits and downfalls of tablet PCs.</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Member C explores the benefits and downfalls of tablet computers.</span>
			
			<h4>Process</h4>

			<ol>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Think about what the technology goals are for the company and what information and resources you will need to tackle this project.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Research and then discuss the components of each system you’re recommending. Are any components better suited for the particular needs of certain types of employees (sales representatives versus</span></li>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>Laptops, tablet PCs, and tablet computers have their own merits as computing systems. Being aware of the options in the marketplace, knowing how to analyze the trade-offs of different designs, and recognizing the different needs each type of computer fulfills allows you to become a better consumer as well as a better computer user.</p>

			<h3>Green Computing</h3>
			<p>Ethical conduct is a stream of decisions you make all day long. In this exercise, you’ll research and then role-play a complicated ethical situation. The role you play may or may not match your own personal beliefs, but your research and use of logic will enable you to represent whichever view is assigned. An arbitrator will watch and comment on both sides of the arguments, and together, the team will agree on an ethical solution.</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>Green computing—conducting computing needs with the least possible amount of power and impact on the environment—is on everyone’s minds. Although it’s hard to argue with an environmentally conscious agenda, the pinch to our pocketbooks and the loss of some comforts sometimes makes green computing difficult. Businesses, including colleges, need to consider a variety of issues and concerns before jumping into a complete green overhaul.</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>Research Areas to Consider</h4>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">End-of-life management: e-waste and recycling</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Energy-efficient devices</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Renewable resources used in computer manufacturing</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Costs of green computing</span>
			<span class="psudoUlLi">Government funding and incentives</span>

			<h4>Process</h4>
			<ol>				
				<li><span class="notStrong">Divide the class into teams.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong"> Research the areas cited above and devise a scenario in which your college is considering modifying its current technology setup to a more green information technology (IT) strategy.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should write a summary that provides background information for their character—for example, environmentalist, college IT administrator, or arbitrator—and that details their character’s behaviors to set the stage for the role-playing event. Then, team members should create an outline to use during the role-playing event.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should arrange a mutually convenient time to meet for the exchange, using either the collaboration feature of <span class="strongDBlue" onclick="window.open('http://www.myitlab.com','_blank')">MyITLab</span> or the discussion board feature of your course management software or by meeting in person.</span></li>
				<li><span class="notStrong">Team members should present their case to the class or submit a PowerPoint presentation for review by the rest of the class, along with the summary and resolution they developed.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>As technology becomes ever more prevalent and integrated into our lives, more and more ethical dilemmas will present themselves. Being able to understand and evaluate both sides of the argument, while responding in a personally or socially ethical manner, will be an important skill.</p>
